1. User profile and repository data were gathered through paginated API requests to GitHub, using authorization headers for secure access, in Pyhthon. Repositories were accessed via each userâ€™s repository endpoint, with pagination ensuring up to 500 repositories were retrieved while managing rate limits with strategic pauses.
2. Having a wiki appears to be beneficial for repository engagement, as repositories with a wiki (regardless of having projects or not) have higher average stars than those without.

3. Based on above insight, developers should prioritize a comprehensive wiki with clear documentation to enhance repository appeal and foster greater user interaction and stars.
